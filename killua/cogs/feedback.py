    You can submit 9 types of feedback:

    `topic` - suggestion for a topic for `k!topic`
    `8ball` - suggestion for a response for `k8ball`
    `hug` - submit a hug text or image (Killua only) 
    `apply` - apply for the team, we are looking for artists, programmer, people looking out for the server etc. Of course being part of the team comes with it's advantages
    `general` - you just wanna give general feedback to us, no specific or too many categories for the other options
    `idea` - you have a good idea for a command (like `k!book <booktitle>`, a idea I had today and I wil implement cause it's cool). Please describe it as detailed as possible though
    `feature`-request - request a feature, kinda like idea but idk. Again, lease describe it as detailed as possible
    `complain` - complain about something
    `compliment` -  compliment a feature of Killua

    **This command has a 1 hour cooldown, for bug reporting please use `k!bug`, abuse will lead to blacklisting**
