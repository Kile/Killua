INFO = (
    "This bot is themed after the character Killua from the anime [hunter x hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_×_Hunter)."
    + """
I chose this character because it was sort of a role model I had during a tough time and I wanted to give back by creating a bot that would best represent the character.
At that point I had never programmed in python before, but I had a goal and I taught myself (through some pingspams in the support servers) how to code step by step to achieve that goal.

Killua has become a way I continue to teach myself programming and by now it has taught me a lot. The bot was never build to profit. 
And so even though I myself invested quite a lot of money into the bot, Killua will barely have any paywalls at all. If you do like the project, there is a patreon, however if you don't want to spend money, Killua will still have many things to offer for you.

If you're reading this that means you're using Killua, so I want to thank you for that. Being the only developer on this pretty massive codebase is not easy, but knowing people enjoy bot makes it worth it :)

A beginners guide of the greed island card system

    f"""If you are not familiar with how this works in the anime: 

The main goal of the game is to obtain all 100 cards in the book. How hard it is to obtain a card is determined by it's **rank**. You can find it on the top right of the card. Next to it to the right is a number. This number times {ALLOWED_AMOUNT_MULTIPLE} is the maximum amount of those cards to exist globally. If that limit is exceeded you can't obtain any more cards unless someone looses one of their copies which means one 
other person can obtain the card again""",
    f"""On the top left, you can see the card number. 
Typically, spell cards have a number one thousand and ... and item cards have a number less than 100. Cards with a number below 100 count towards your goal of collecting all 100 **restricted slot** cards.
When you obtain a card which has an id below 100 but you already have one in your restricted slots, or the card id is above 100, the card comes into your **free slots**. You can have a maximum of {FREE_SLOTS} cards in your free slots""",
    """I have mentioned before that there are **spell cards**. You can use them to steal cards from other users, gamble and a lot more. To use a spell card, use `use <card> <arguments>`. Some spell cards only work in a **short range**. In discord terms that means that the target must have send a message recently in the channel the command is used in. You can also use permament spell cards to protect yourself from others or tranform cards into fakes.""",
    """A word about **fakes**. Fakes can be created with the spell card 1020 and look like real cards in the book but are not. The main usecase I seem them as is bait. You can't sell fakes, you can't use them and they don't count towards the 100 card goal. 
If you want to swap out a fake in your album with a real card in your free slots or the other way around, use `swap <card_id>`. If you want to get rid of a fake, make sure it's in your free slots and discard it with `discard <card_id>`""",
    """You have reached the end of the introduction!

Now it's time for you to explore the world of cards, steal, collect, form alliances and so on. 

Do you want to add a card to the game you have a good idea for? That is possible, if you can make the card design with image we will be happy to have a look at your idea!

Have fun hunters
