## What is Killua?

I started Killua as a way to learn python and different programming concepts. It definitely was not the easiest way to do it, but it got me to a good level of python knowledge plus having a cool bot! As a result, I greatly appreciate issues, PRs and contributions enhancing my code.

## Running Killua locally

First, set up a virtual environment. Do so with `python3 -m venv env; source env/bin/activate`. To leave the virtual environment after you are done, simply run `deactivate`

`requirements.txt` contains the libraries you'll need. To install them use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You will need a Mongodb account. Why do I use mongodb and not SQL? In my opinion, mongo is easier to use and you can manually add and remove data.

You will have to create a mongodb account [here](https://www.mongodb.com), then follow the instructions in [`setup.py`](https://github/Kile/Killua/blob/main/setup.py) and then run `python3 setup.py` or choose the "setup database" option in the menu to get the database set up

You will also need a file named `config.json` having the layout like this:

```plaintext
{
    "token": "token",
    
    "mongodb": "your-mongodb-token",
    "pxlapi": "pxlapi-token",
    "patreon": "patreon-api-token",
    "dbl_token": "dbl-token",
    "topgg_token": "topgg-token",
    "password": "vote-pages-password",
    "port": 8000,
    "ipc": "ipc-token"
}
```

You can finally run the bot in development or production environment in a menu by running `./run.sh`

**If you add any commands, please make sure to also add tests for it. A document explaining how tests for Killua work can be found** [**here**](https://github.com/Kile/Killua/blob/main/killua/tests/README.md)

If you don't like me using one of your images for the hug command, please contact me on discord `Kile#0606` or on `kile@killua.dev`

If you have any further questions, join my discord server or dm me!
